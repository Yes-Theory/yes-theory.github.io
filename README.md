## Technical support  
### I get an error when I try to join the group.  
Facebook seems to have a problem and on some devices it's not possible to join.  
There is a possible solution for Smartphones:  
You will need Chrome or Firefox Focus  
* Click on the link
* Click on the three dots at the top right
* Click on "Open with..."
* Choose Firefox Focus or Chrome
* Click on the three dots on the top right
* Click on "Request desktop site" or "Desktop site"
* Sometimes it helps to close the site and to try again  

Also try to join on another device it will sync across devices.  

## Event planing
Awesome! Hosting a Yes Theory event is one of the best experiences you will ever make. To simplify your life we would like to support you with your planing.  
## Where should I start?
Maybe you already know the people. If so you could start with finding a date. You can use the [tool Doodle](https://doodle.com/de/) (use the free version) to find a date which suits most of the people. Also don't forget the exact time. Waiting more than 2 hours in the cold may not be the seek discomfort you are looking for.  
If you don't know many people you might want to join a [group](#groups) or a [groupchat](#groupchats) and use this as a base.
## Find a meeting location
Now that you have found a date and the Yes Fams you have to decide a location where you will meet. I recommend a HBF (main trainstation) or a big square. In cologne the big square between the Dom and the HBF is perfect for the first meet.
## Activities
There is so much stuff you can do. Here are some examples:  
* Christmas market
* Ice skating
* Indoor rock climbing
* Dancing
* Free hugs
* Helping homeless people
* Secret Santa (Wichteln)
* Party  

## Spread the message
You almost made it. Now it would be awesome to see other people joining your event. Start it by creating a Messenger or WhatsApp group. Once the group is created copy the join link and add it to the group description. By doing that you allow other people to share the event.
### Yes Theory Fam Germany
To reach the most amount of people you should put your event on the Yes Theory Fam Germany Facebook Page.
* Click on events/Veranstaltungen
* Click on "Create Event" or "Veranstaltung erstellen"
* Add the event details and don't forget to add the link to your eventchat  

### Groups and Groupchats
It might be some work but it's definetly worth it. Take a look at the [Groups](#groups) and [Groupchats](#groupchats) and find the ones that are close to your event location. Send to the groupchats a nice explanation of your event with the key information also stay around for questions that might pop up and add them as a FAQ to your Eventchat description. For other Groups you can do the same as you did for the "Yes Theory Fam Germany" group.  
### This page
Under [Eventchats](#eventchats) please add your event. It helps organizing future events and keeps track of past events. Also if you ever get stuck at some point. Take a look at this section maybe someone who already did an event might be able to help you.  
## Equipment
Currently there is no equipment from this side. But if you have a loudspeaker, a seek discomfort flag or anything else you would like to share, you can add it to this list by editing this page or sending me a DM at [Noel Schenk](https://www.facebook.com/noel.elias.schenk).
* ex. seek discomfort flag in [Berlin](#) provided by [AwesomePerson](#)  

## Legal
If you want to sell tickets you should take a look at this page: [Rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen für Ihre Betriebsfeier](https://www.business-wissen.de/artikel/veranstaltungen-planen-rechtliche-rahmenbedingungen-fuer-ihre-betriebsfeier/)
Please stay within the law. The trouble is IMHO not worth it.
