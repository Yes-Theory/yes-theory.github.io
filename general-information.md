# General Information
## Goal
We are ambassadors for our group/country. We serve other Yes Fam members by connecting groups and countries.  
## Structure
Currently we start at a group level (group representatives) who share a chat for a country. This group decides who should represent the country for them.  
How those representatives are elected will be decided within those groups. I recommend a simple majority vote.
  
The country representatives share another chat group.  
### Chat Recommendation
Name of the group: OC - Yes Theory **Countryname**  
Description of the group:  
Organizing Committee Yes Theory India  
Invitation Link: 📲 invitation link  
The goal ist to better connect Yes Fam Groups within **Countryname**.  
It would be awesome if each representative from every **Countryname** group and groupchat is present in this chat.

## Group representative
The group representative is responsible for keeping in touch with his group and checking in with the country representative from time to time.  
It would be awesome if you could host local Yes Theory meetups and events.  
## Country representative
The country representative is responsible for keeping in touch with the other group representatives and checking in with the global OC - Yes Theory chat.  
It would be awesome if you could host national Yes Theory meetups and events.  
## Technical representative
Because not everyone is a nerd and this page is getting bigger by the hour there may be a technical representative for your country. Her or She can access curtain files and edit your countries page. If you have a country representative it's mentioned on the countries page under "Technical support".
