## I get an error when I try to join the group.

Facebook seems to have a problem and on some devices it's not possible to join.  
There is a possible solution for Smartphones:  
You will need Chrome or Firefox Focus

- Click on the link
- Click on the three dots at the top right
- Click on "Open with..."
- Choose Firefox Focus or Chrome
- Click on the three dots on the top right
- Click on "Request desktop site" or "Desktop site"
- Sometimes it helps to close the site and to try again

Also try to join on another device it will sync across devices.
