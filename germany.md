## Technical support  
### Technical representative
**Looking for a technical representative**  

## Event planning

### Want to host a Yes Fam event?
Awesome! Hosting a Yes Fam event is one of the best decisions and experiences you will ever make. To simplify your life we would like to help with your planning.
### Where should I start?
Maybe you already know people who would be interested in attending. If so you could start with finding a date. You can use [Doodle](https://doodle.com/de/) (use the free version) to find a date which suits most attendees. Also don't forget the exact time. Waiting more than 2 hours in the cold may not be the **"Seek Discomfort"** you are looking for.  
If you don't know many people or want to get even more people to participate in your event you might want to join a [group](#groups) or a [group chat](#group-chats).
### Find a meeting location
Now that you have found a date and the Yes Fam you have to decide on a location where you will meet. I recommend a HBF (central station) or a big square. For example in Cologne the big square between the Dom and the HBF is perfect for the first meet.
### Activities
There is so much stuff you can do. Here are some examples:  
* Visit a christmas market
* Ice skating
* Indoor rock climbing
* Dancing
* Free hugs
* Helping homeless people
* Secret Santa (Wichteln)
* Party
* Hiking
* Cooking
* Visit a Museum
* Concert
* Bicycle tour
* Theater
* Games night  

### Spread the message
You almost made it. Now it would be awesome to see other people joining your event. Start by creating a Messenger or WhatsApp group. Once the group is created copy the join link and add it to the group description. By doing that you allow other people to share the event.
### Yes Theory Fam Germany
To reach the most amount of people you should put your event on the Yes Theory Fam Germany Facebook Page.
* Click on Events/Veranstaltungen
* Click on "Create Event" or "Veranstaltung erstellen"
* Add the event details and don't forget to add the link to your eventchat  

### Groups and Group chats
It might be some work but it's definetly worth it. Take a look at the [groups](#groups) and [group chats](#group-chats) and find the ones that are close to your event location. Send to the group chats a nice explanation of your event with the key 

also stay around for questions that might pop up and add them as a FAQ to your Eventchat description. For other Groups you can do the same as you did for the "Yes Theory Fam Germany" group.  
### This page
Under [Event chats](#eventchats) please add your event. It helps organizing future events and keeps track of past events. Also if you ever get stuck at some point. Take a look at this section maybe someone who already did an event might be able to help you.  
## Equipment
Currently there is no equipment from this site. But if you have a loudspeaker, a seek discomfort flag or anything else you would like to share, you can add it to this list by editing this page or sending me a DM at [Noel Schenk](https://www.facebook.com/noel.elias.schenk).
* ex. seek discomfort flag in [Berlin](#) provided by [AwesomePerson](#)  

## Legal
If you want to sell tickets you should take a look at this page: [Rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen für Ihre Betriebsfeier](https://www.business-wissen.de/artikel/veranstaltungen-planen-rechtliche-rahmenbedingungen-fuer-ihre-betriebsfeier/)
Please stay within the law. The trouble is IMHO not worth it.
This document is not complete and we are also not responsible for your event. If you need more information you might want to take a look at this page: [eventfaq](https://eventfaq.de/checklisten/).
